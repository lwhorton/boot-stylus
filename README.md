# boot-stylus

### Compile .styl files into clojurescript modules.

Much of CSS is miserable- the syntax, the specificity rules, the cascading,
etc.  Preprocessors make *some* things much more tolerable, but they don't
solve the most pressing problem: modularity. The new-ish
[css-modules](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules) is an attempt to
make css more modular. Since I hate writing css so much, I wanted to go one
step further and utilize [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). Thus was born
boot-stylus, a boot task to convert `.styl` files inside your `:source-paths`
into cljs modules that can be brought in via the standard `(:require
[my-namespace.my-module])` scheme.

## How to use

> Â¡IMPORTANT! boot-stylus currently depends on node in order to run. As soon as
> someone decides to port a clojure css-modules generator, that dependency will

List boot-stylus as a depencency:
```clojure
(set-env!
  :dependencies '[[lwhorton/boot-stylus "0.0.2-SNAPSHOT" :scope "test"]])
```

Add stylus to your build task in the `build.boot` file:
```clojure
(require
  '[lwhorton.boot-stylus.core :refer [stylus]])

(deftask build []
  (comp
    (stylus)
    (cljs)
    (target :dir #{"target"})))
```

Now any file inside `:source-paths` that ends in `.styl` will be compiled into
a `.cljs` module. Namespaces are auto-generated following the convention
`/{path}/{to}/{file}.styl -> (ns {path}.{to_file}.{file})`.

For example, `my_project/my_feature/styles.styl` will be compiled into
`my_project/my_feature/styles.cljs`.

## Example

Given the stylus:
```stylus
;; my_project/my_feature/styles.styl
.foo
  color blue

.bar
  color green
```

The generated module will look something like this:
```clojure
;; my_project/my_feature/styles.cljs
(ns my-project.my-feature.styles)

(def .__foo__[hash] ".foo { color: blue; }")
(def .__bar__[hash] ".bar { color: green; }")
```

Which you can require from inside your clojurescript:
```clojure
(ns my-project.my-feature.core
  (:require [my-project.my-feature.styles :as s]))

;; hiccup
(defn render []
  [:div
    [:p {:class s/foo} "Goodbye css"]
    [:p {:class s/bar} "Hello stylus modules"]])
```

That will ultimately render the html:
```
<div>
    <p class="__foo__[hash]">Goodbye css</p>
    <p class="__bar__[hash]">Hello world</p>
</div>
```

## How does it work?

Ultimately the compiled css is added to the DOM via an inline `<style>` tag.
Each compiled cljs module utilizes a tiny runtime that handles
adding/removing/updating styles tags. If a styl module is loaded into the
browser, the runtime will look for an existing style tag corresponding to the
module's name, and either generate a new tag, or update contents of an existing
tag. Hashes are constructed in order to work with live-reloading tools such as
figwheel or boot-reload.
